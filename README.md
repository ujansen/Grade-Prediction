Trying to predict the grade of a student using various regression models

Prediction of continuous data is one of the most common applications of Machine Learning and in this scenario, I have tried various regression models to predict the grade of a student using plenty of other features like number of absent instances, number of failures, access to internet, parent's education, school support, etc., and used the model that gave me the best scores.

The dataset for the model can be found here: https://www.kaggle.com/dipam7/student-grade-prediction

I made a few changes to the dataset by removing G1 and G2 from the feature list and have used the other features to predict G3, which I renamed to grade.
